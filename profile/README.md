Nicole Kidman hopes her new erotic thriller, “Babygirl,” is a “liberating story” for women, as she found it “very freeing” to make.

At the film’s Venice Film Festival press conference, Kidman spoke on the raunchy themes of the movie, saying it’s “obviously about sex, it’s about desire, it’s about your inner thoughts, it’s about secrets, it’s about marriage, it’s about truth, power, consent.”

She continued, “This is one woman’s story and this is, I hope, a very liberating story. It’s told by a woman, through her gaze — Halina [Reijn] wrote it and she directed it — and that’s to me what made it so unique because suddenly I was going to be in the hands of a woman with this material. It was very dear to our shared instincts and very freeing.”
